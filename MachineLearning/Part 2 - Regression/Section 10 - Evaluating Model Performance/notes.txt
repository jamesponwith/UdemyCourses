---R-Squared---

SSres = SUM (Yi - Yi^)^2
SStot = SUM (Yi - Yavg)^2

R^2 = 1 - ( SSres / SStot)

The goal is to minimize SSres and SStot  because this represents the best fit line meaning that there is the minimum amount of distance between the data points and the line. 
While SSres and SStot become smaller R^2 is inching towards a value of 1 which is ideal but never happens.



---Adjusted R-Squared---

R^2 - Goodness of fit (greater the better)

Problem with this - when you add more variables to your model

if you add another variable will never decrease R^2

Adujusted R^2:

1 - (1 - R^2)(n-1 / n - p - 1)

p - number of regressors
n - sample size

Adjusted R squared penalizes the model for variables that do not help. (Penalized for each added varaible but balanced out if variable is helping model)
