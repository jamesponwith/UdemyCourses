Introducting Phat and Yhat.

Phat - a probability that we have calculated.

Yhat - the prediction based on the logistic curve.
	   If the data point is less than a 50% probability it will be plotted
	   down. If the data point is sitting higher than the 50% line than the
	   data point is plotted upwards.
